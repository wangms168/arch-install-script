   This document is a guide for installing Arch Linux from the live system
   booted with the official installation image. Before installing, it
   would be advised to view the FAQ. For conventions used in this
   document, see Help:Reading. In particular, code examples may contain
   placeholders (formatted in italics) that must be replaced manually.

   For more detailed instructions, see the respective ArchWiki articles or
   the various programs' man pages, both linked from this guide. For
   interactive help, the IRC channel and the forums are also available.

   Arch Linux should run on any x86_64-compatible machine with a minimum
   of 512 MB RAM. A basic installation with all packages from the base
   group should take less than 800 MB of disk space. As the installation
   process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this guide
   assumes a working internet connection is available.

Pre-installation

   Download and boot the installation medium as explained in
   Category:Getting and installing Arch. You will be logged in on the
   first virtual console as the root user, and presented with a Zsh shell
   prompt.

   To switch to a different console--for example, to view this guide with
   ELinks alongside the installation--use the Alt+arrow shortcut. To edit
   configuration files, nano, vi and vim are available.

Set the keyboard layout

   The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:
# ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz

   To modify the layout, append a corresponding file name to loadkeys(1),
   omitting path and file extension. For example, to set a German keyboard
   layout:
# loadkeys de-latin1

   Console fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/ and can
   likewise be set with setfont(8).

Verify the boot mode

   If UEFI mode is enabled on an UEFI motherboard, Archiso will boot Arch
   Linux accordingly via systemd-boot. To verify this, list the efivars
   directory:
# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars

   If the directory does not exist, the system may be booted in BIOS or
   CSM mode. Refer to your motherboard's manual for details.

Connect to the Internet

   The installation image enables the dhcpcd daemon for wired network
   devices on boot. The connection may be verified with ping:
# ping archlinux.org

   If no connection is available, stop the dhcpcd service with systemctl
   stop dhcpcd@interface where the interface name can be tab-completed.
   Proceed to configure the network as described in Network configuration.

Update the system clock

   Use timedatectl(1) to ensure the system clock is accurate:
# timedatectl set-ntp true

   To check the service status, use timedatectl status.

Partition the disks

   When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a block
   device such as /dev/sda or /dev/nvme0n1. To identify these devices, use
   lsblk or fdisk.
# fdisk -l

   Results ending in rom, loop or airoot may be ignored.

   The following partitions are required for a chosen device:
     * One partition for the root directory /.
     * If UEFI is enabled, an EFI system partition.

   Note: Swap space can be set on a separate partition or a swap file.

   To modify partition tables, use fdisk or parted.
# fdisk /dev/sda

   See Partitioning for more information.
   Note: If you want to create any stacked block devices for LVM, disk
   encryption or RAID, do it now.

Format the partitions

   Once the partitions have been created, each must be formatted with an
   appropriate file system. For example, to format the root partition on
   /dev/sda1 with ext4, run:
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

   If you created a partition for swap (for example /dev/sda3), initialize
   it with mkswap:
# mkswap /dev/sda3
# swapon /dev/sda3

   See File systems#Create a file system for details.

Mount the file systems

   Mount the file system on the root partition to /mnt, for example:
# mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

   Create mount points for any remaining partitions and mount them
   accordingly:
# mkdir /mnt/boot
# mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot

   genfstab will later detect mounted file systems and swap space.

Installation

Select the mirrors

   Packages to be installed must be downloaded from mirror servers, which
   are defined in /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist. On the live system, all
   mirrors are enabled, and sorted by their synchronization status and
   speed at the time the installation image was created.

   The higher a mirror is placed in the list, the more priority it is
   given when downloading a package. You may want to edit the file
   accordingly, and move the geographically closest mirrors to the top of
   the list, although other criteria should be taken into account.

   This file will later be copied to the new system by pacstrap, so it is
   worth getting right.

Install the base packages

   Use the pacstrap script to install the base package group:
# pacstrap /mnt base

   This group does not include all tools from the live installation, such
   as btrfs-progs or specific wireless firmware; see packages.x86_64 for
   comparison.

   To install packages and other groups such as base-devel, append the
   names to pacstrap (space separated) or to individual pacman commands
   after the #Chroot step.

Configure the system

Fstab

   Generate an fstab file (use -U or -L to define by UUID or labels,
   respectively):
# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

   Check the resulting file in /mnt/etc/fstab afterwards, and edit it in
   case of errors.

Chroot

   Change root into the new system:
# arch-chroot /mnt

Time zone

   Set the time zone:
# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

   Run hwclock(8) to generate /etc/adjtime:
# hwclock --systohc

   This command assumes the hardware clock is set to UTC. See Time#Time
   standard for details.

Localization

   Uncomment en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 and other needed locales in
   /etc/locale.gen, and generate them with:
# locale-gen

   Set the LANG variable in locale.conf(5) accordingly, for example:
/etc/locale.conf
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

   If you set the keyboard layout, make the changes persistent in
   vconsole.conf(5):
/etc/vconsole.conf
KEYMAP=de-latin1

Network configuration

   Create the hostname file:
/etc/hostname
myhostname

   Add matching entries to hosts(5):
/etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
::1             localhost
127.0.1.1       myhostname.localdomain  myhostname

   If the system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of
   127.0.1.1.

   Complete the network configuration for the newly installed environment.

Initramfs

   Creating a new initramfs is usually not required, because mkinitcpio
   was run on installation of the linux package with pacstrap.

   For special configurations, modify the mkinitcpio.conf(5) file and
   recreate the initramfs image:
# mkinitcpio -p linux

Root password

   Set the root password:
# passwd

Boot loader

   A Linux-capable boot loader must be installed in order to boot Arch
   Linux. See Category:Boot loaders for available choices.

   If you have an Intel CPU, install the intel-ucode package in addition,
   and enable microcode updates.

Reboot

   Exit the chroot environment by typing exit or pressing Ctrl+D.

   Optionally manually unmount all the partitions with umount -R /mnt:
   this allows noticing any "busy" partitions, and finding the cause with
   fuser(1).

   Finally, restart the machine by typing reboot: any partitions still
   mounted will be automatically unmounted by systemd. Remember to remove
   the installation media and then login into the new system with the root
   account.

Post-installation

   See General recommendations for system management directions and
   post-installation tutorials (like setting up a graphical user
   interface, sound or a touchpad).

   For a list of applications that may be of interest, see List of
   applications.
